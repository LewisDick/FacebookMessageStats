# INSTALLATION / SETUP
Usage of this script requires that at least python 3.5 is installed on your system. A detailed guide on how to do this can be found [here](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/installation/)

For this script to work, you must download the data that facebook contains about you, in JSON format. This can be done by going to Facebook >Settings>Your Facebook information>Download your information. At which point you can select the JSON format. As seen below:

Place the script inside the root folder of the facebook data. If you are running windows, you can simply click the run.bat file, to initiate the scraping. Otherwise execute the command below:
```
python FacebookMessageStats.py
```
